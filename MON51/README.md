# MON51 Monitor Program
The 8051 monitor program I'm using to get started is Dave Dunfields MON51. Dave has kindly made available 40+ years of source code via [his website](https://dunfield.themindfactory.com/).

I'm not sure what assembler was used to assemble the original assembly code (MON51.ASM). I modified the code so that it would assemble using [ASEM-51 v1.3](https://plit.de/asem-51/download.htm).

Here is a modified version of MON51 - called MON51.a51 - for my RCBus 8051 board that can be assembled using ASEM51 v1.3. I've also included the original copyright information from Dave Dunfield.

The original source code to MON51 can be found in the MONITOR.ZIP file on Dave's website along with MON51.TXT which is a brief user guide.
